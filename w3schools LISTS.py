### 1. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list. ###

# w3schools_list = ["Item1", "Item2", "Item3", "Item4", "Item5"]

# print(list(w3schools_list))

#######                         if statements with LISTS                    #########

# fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
    
# if "apple" in fruits:
#     print("Yes, apple is a fruit!")

#                         ##### 'in' is important part of statements ######


# if 5 == 10 or 4 == 4:
#   print("At least one of the statements is true")

#                         ##### 'or' is important part of statements ######

# Given a Python list of numbers. Turn every item of a list into its square
# aList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
# aList =  [x * x for x in aList]
# print(aList)
