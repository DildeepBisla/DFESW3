          # in this method x variable is going represent the range in the numb_list
          # and pull the numbers till it gets to 9 while (-1) going down 1 

# x = range(6)        #<---- range is to 6 (no list used just range is auto generated) 
# for n in x:         #<---- n is just letter assinged to the iteration in the range 
#   print(n) 

#         # so x is the varibale, its going to have a range of auto populated iteration 
#         # to 6.  n is going to pull the iteration in x till it hit 6 iteration.
