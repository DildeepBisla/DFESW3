# numb_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

# x = numb_list[3:7]
# print(x)

          # in this method x variable is going represent the range in the numb_list
          # and pull the numbers from index 3 to 7 

# x = range(6)        #<---- range is to 6 (no list used just range is auto generated) 
# for n in x:         #<---- n is just letter assinged to the iteration in the range 
#   print(n) 

#         # so x is the varibale, its going to have a range of auto populated iteration 
#         # to 6.  n is going to pull the iteration in x till it hit 6 iteration.
